            <h2 class="major-title">What are our goals?</h2>
            <p>
                Babies are the past, present, and future. Literally. We were all once babies in the past, we as a race need to have babies in the present to survive,
                and lastly, the future will be run by said present day babies. That got the folks at Baby Trainers thinking...

            <h3 class="title">Babies: Untapped Liquid Gold</h3>

            <p>
                Baby Trainer's aim to use the untapped resource of babies and their extreme ability of memorization to allow the rapid fast
                memorization of coding languages. If looked at in an emotionless, inhumane way, babies are the perfect candidates to create
                absolute <strong>GENII</strong> in software development, which will in turn <strong>revolutionize</strong> the modern day world. With such an influx of advanced,
                prodigy level babies, the online infrastructure of the world will face unprecedented amounts of technological advances in a very
                short period of time (<em>By the time the babies can actually speak and stand up on their own</em>).

            <h3 class="title">So How DO We Train Your Baby?</h3>
            <img class="img" src="./images/smart-baby.jpg" alt="A baby clad in big glasses, giving off a smart impression">
            <p>
                The procedure that Baby Trainers implement in order to have your baby learn the secrets of the coding world is very simple. After the 
                immediate birth of the infant, our <strong>certified and vetted</strong> baby trainer will remove the baby from its mother's loving touch and instantly 
                enroll them into a harsh 6 hour per day, 5 days per week bootcamp distributed by TTP (<em>Tech Talent Pipeline</em>) teaching them the basics of 
                Git, Github, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React until they are able to speak and cry for food (<em>or help!</em>). This advanced and intuitive camp is crafted 
                by some of the most intelligent instructors and have extremely friendly TA's that will assist your baby's needs to ensure as smooth of a process as possible.

            <h2 class="major-title">How Do We Use Donations?</h2>
            <h3 class="title">Monetary Donations</h3>
            <img class="img" id="money-baby" src="./images/money-baby.jpg" alt="An adorable baby in a money costume">
            <p>
                For all monetary donations, we use a staggering 2% of the funds towards allowing these babies to learn software development skills. The rest
                of the funds go towards legal fee's and lawyers, as apparently the operations we carry out are vulnerable to allegations of "kidnapping" and 
                "illegitimacy". 
            </p>
            <h3 class="title">Baby Donations</h3>
            <img class="big-img" src="./images/baby-donation.jpg" alt="A woman handing over her baby">
            <p>
                When a user donates a baby, they are give up the rights to the baby, allowing the certified and vetted trainers from Baby Trainers to take them
                to a gathering hall in which they are subjected to countless hours of extreme educational content, teaching them all sorts of imperative software 
                engineering skills that will allow them to break through the doors of the software engineering world and accomplish great things. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> We request all donated babies belong to the donator, as after a recent lawsuit, the court decided donating another individual's 
                baby is illegal.
